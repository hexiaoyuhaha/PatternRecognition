Following are the data elements that we would like the CMU students to work on obfuscating and/or pattern recognition.  I realize some of these fields are not in the data set that we provided them - but that means that we are interested in pattern recognition for those.
 
 - SSN# or Driver’s license #’s
- Credit card numbers
- Health Insurance or Benefit eligibility ID numbers
- DOB (day/month/year) IF linked to First and Last name (or First Initial and last name)
- Health, Disability, or prescription Drug or Health Insurance information IF linked to First and Last name (or First Initial and last name)
- Any information for children under the age of 13
