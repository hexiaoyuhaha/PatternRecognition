# Pattern Recognition

1. Pattern recognition using regular expression
2. Pattern recognition using open source libraries
3. Pattern recognition using third party tools 


##	Open source libraries for Phone Number
We explored one library for phone number detection, we will explore more library for date detection, address detection in the future.

### Google libphonenumber

Google's provides Java, C++ and JavaScript library for parsing, formatting, and validating international phone numbers.  https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumberThis library can validate phone number, extract country code and national number, reformat the number, etc. A [quick example](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber#quick-examples). A [JavaScript Demo](https://rawgit.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/master/javascript/i18n/phonenumbers/demo-compiled.html)


There are several third-party ports of the phone number library supporting various languages:

*   C#: https://github.com/aidanbebbington/libphonenumber-csharp
*   PHP: https://github.com/giggsey/libphonenumber-for-php
*   Python: https://github.com/daviddrysdale/python-phonenumbers
*   Ruby: https://github.com/sstephenson/global_phone
*   javascript (stripped-down version): https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/libphonenumber-js
*   objective-c: https://github.com/iziz/libPhoneNumber-iOS

You can try it with your own number. For example, the demo output looks like this:

##	Paid third party software

Generally, open source libraries already provide satisfying functionality for daily uses. But if more advanced functionality is required, weâ€™ve found some third party software to provide more sophisticated functionalities. ### TwilioFor example, [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/lookup) can be used for number detection. It support functionality such as:

- Find Caller Name: Get the Caller ID Name (CNAM) for a phone number
- Identify carrier: Know which carrier is connected to a user's number
- Check type: Determine if a number is a landline, VoIP, or mobile---
